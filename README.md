# Version Control Workshop Exercise

Welcome to the **Version Control Workshop Exercise**! This exercise is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of version control using Git and GitHub. In this exercise, you will learn how to fork a repository, invite collaborators, and perform essential Git operations like pushing and pulling code changes.

## Exercise Overview

This exercise is centered around building a simple company website for "Version Control Experts Ltd.," a fictional company specializing in version control solutions for large-scale enterprises. The website structure consists of several pages, including the Main Page, About Page, Contact Page, and Services Page. Each page represents a different aspect of web development and collaboration.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the exercise:

1. **Fork this Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository to create your copy. This will allow you to work on the project independently.

2. **Clone Your Forked Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

3. **Work on User Stories**: Open the project files and start working on the user stories provided in the README. Each user story corresponds to a specific task related to the website content and structure.

4. **Collaborate**: If you are working in groups, collaborate with your team members to complete the tasks. You can use Git and GitHub to manage collaborative development.

5. **Push and Pull**: Use `git push` to send your changes to your GitHub repository and `git pull` to fetch and incorporate changes made by your collaborators.

6. **Testing**: Test your website locally to ensure that it looks and functions as expected.

7. **Commit and Submit**: Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages and submit your work when you are satisfied.

## User Stories

1. **About Page**: Create content for the About Page to introduce the company and its mission.

2. **Contact Page**: Develop a Contact Page with contact details and a functional contact form.

3. **Main Page (index.html)**: Craft engaging content for the Main Page, highlighting the company's services.

4. **Services Page**: Design a Services Page listing the version control solutions and products offered.

## Collaboration Guidelines

- Collaborate with your fellow students by inviting them as collaborators to your forked repository.
- Practice proper Git etiquette by creating branches for each user story and making clear, concise commits.
- Discuss and review each other's code and provide constructive feedback.

## Conclusion

By completing this exercise, you will gain practical experience in version control, collaborative development, and web content creation. Feel free to explore and enhance the website beyond the provided user stories. Happy coding!
